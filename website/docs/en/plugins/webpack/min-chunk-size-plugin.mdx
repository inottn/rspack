# MinChunkSizePlugin

When adding code-splitting points in your application, you may end up with very small chunks. The `MinChunkSizePlugin` helps ensure that generated chunks are not smaller than a specified size threshold. It optimizes the output by merging chunks smaller than the minimum size into other chunks.

```js
new rspack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({
  // Options...
});
```

## Options

### minChunkSize

- **Type:** `number`

Specifies the minimum chunk size (in bytes). Chunks smaller than this size will attempt to merge with other chunks.

```js
new rspack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({
  minChunkSize: 10000,
});
```
